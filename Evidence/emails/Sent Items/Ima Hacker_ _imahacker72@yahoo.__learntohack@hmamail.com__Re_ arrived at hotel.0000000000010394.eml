Don't know what's wrong with that firesheep program - couldn't get it to =
work. It picked up some guy logging into yahoo, but came up with "error" =
and didn't let me hijack his session.

Maybe it only works on wifi?

Still, he also checked his email via pop, so scored his password that =
way!

Some people are so dumb!

  Hey,

  Just got to the hotel in brissie and connected my pc - looks like =
they're only using a network hub! I can see everyone else's traffic, =
it's awesome!

  Looks like one guy is working going to be on the gold coast, soon - =
judging by his browsing history!

  Might try that firesheep thing you were telling me about later, see if =
I can get into any accounts!

  Ima

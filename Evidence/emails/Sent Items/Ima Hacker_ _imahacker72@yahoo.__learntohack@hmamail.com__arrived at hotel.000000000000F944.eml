Hey,

Just got to the hotel in brissie and connected my pc - looks like =
they're only using a network hub! I can see everyone else's traffic, =
it's awesome!

Looks like one guy is working going to be on the gold coast, soon - =
judging by his browsing history!

Might try that firesheep thing you were telling me about later, see if I =
can get into any accounts!

Ima
